# Low Calorie Desserts List Exercise

## Project Description
This exercise demonstrates the use of array methods (filter, sort, map) in React to create a filtered and sorted list of desserts. The application displays desserts with less than 500 calories in ascending order of their caloric content.

## Features
- Filters out desserts with more than 500 calories
- Sorts desserts by calorie count in ascending order
- Displays desserts in a formatted list showing name and calorie count

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript Array Methods (filter, sort, map)
- JSX

## Code Highlights
- Used array method chaining for efficient data transformation
- Implemented conditional filtering based on calorie count
- Applied sorting logic for ascending calorie display
- Created formatted list items using JSX

## Learning Outcomes
- Practiced using multiple array methods together
- Implemented data transformation logic in React
- Worked with props and component structure
- Applied basic list rendering in React
